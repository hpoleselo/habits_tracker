# Habits Tracker
Analyze your habits by taking a photo from your habits tracker sheet.

Implementation ideas:
- Divide taken image in two sections, one for handwritten recognition (will be assigned to a row)
- Another section

- Implement OpenCV algorithm to retrieve handwritten habits
- Implement OpenCV counter for each habit (recognize X squares and count them)
- Create dataframe for each habit wrt. to its counter
- Create graphics for analytics
- Get current data and output in a nice format along with the graph and maybe a digital sheet?
- Put it in a AWS container along with Telegram Forecaster using Firebase?
